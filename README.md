# MultiTwitch
Simple web-application for displaying multiple Twitch streams on the same screen. Built using base HTML, CSS and Javascript aswell as Twitch embeds.
This project was originally built for personal use only. 
For that reason the application is not at all responsive for mobile devices, I designed it solely for use on desktops.

## Installation
To install, simply clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:WilmarvdPlas/MultiTwitch.git`
